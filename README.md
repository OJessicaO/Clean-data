This repository contains three files: README.md, run_analysis.R and CodeBook.md.

run_analysis.R gets data from the UCI HAR Dataset present in the working directory. It gives out a dataset called "full" containing a combination of data from the test and training sets. For more information, refer to CodeBook.md.

CodeBook.md provides information on the variables of the dataset including brief descriptions. It also explains how the data has been extracted from the UCI HAR Data and the transformations applied to tidy up the data.
